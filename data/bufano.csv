Frank Cresci Plaza,"""St. Francis of Assisi"" has stood on the corner of the union hiring hall parking lot, facing Fisherman's Wharf since 1963. This year the Bay Area Longshoremen's Memorial Association has given it and the surrounding park an upgrade, with benches and plantings. ""St. Francis"" is lit all night. One way to see it is from a vintage streetcar rolling by it on the outbound F-Market & Wharves line.",301 Beach Taylor streets,37.806918,-122.414939,13503478,Sam Whiting,square
Valencia Gardens,"Hidden away in a courtyard behind this public housing complex are six species forming a perfect circle. You cannot see them from Valencia Street so you have to know where to turn up Rosa Parks Lane and down Maxwell Court. It dead ends into a courtyard between the community center and the playground. There is a bench for viewing a bear and cubs, two seals, a cat with a mouse on its back facing off against a rabbit, a butterfly and two fish in a school, in various shades of smooth granite.",360-390 Valencia St,37.766979,-122.422252,13503480,Sam Whiting,landscape
City College,"After the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, Bufano decided to create a sculpture out of the melted firearms that people turned in, in protest. The result is ""Saint Francis of the Guns,"" a life-size figure standing in the weedy median between the stairs at the side entrance to City College of San Francisco. Portrayed in ceramic mosaic are the faces of the four martyrs &mdash; Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and RFK.","50 Phelan Ave., San Francisco",37.724695,-122.4529324,13503500,Sam Whiting,square
UCSF Parnassus,"""Bear and Cubs"" is in front and center and its mate, a California Golden Bear is half a block away, both on the north side of Parnassus Avenue. A third Bufano, a bust of the Madonna was added in 1976 in accordance with ""Bufano Day"" at UCSF. It sits on the ground on a pedestal in front of the nursing school but you have to climb a steep hill and tromp through a construction zone to find it.","505 Parnassus Ave., San Francisco",37.7630895,-122.4578144,13503497,Sam Whiting,square
Maritime Museum,"It takes some sleuthing to see these because you have to go through the front doors of this free museum and out the back door to the veranda, where the statues face Aquatic Park. One is a red granite seal with its nose up as if balancing a ball. The other is a frog in black granite. These are sisters to the sculptures at Valencia Gardens, all cast in the 1930s.","900 Beach St., San Francisco",37.8063969,-122.4240805,13503510,Sam Whiting,square
Brotherhood Way,"""Peace,"" dedicated on April 19, 1958, by Mayor George Christopher, was a landmark at San Francisco International Airport until it was airlifted to this new park, on a strip of land that serves as a buffer between roaring Brotherhood Way and a new row of little boxes on a hilltop behind it. Made of stainless steel and rising 38 feet, it looks like a spaceship that could lift off in the prevailing wind if not held in place by a stand made of black and white granite.","800 Brotherhood Way, San Francisco",37.7146179,-122.4802985,12645330,"Paul Chinn, The Chronicle",portrait
Lake Merced,"""Penguin's Prayer"" looks like it was poured the same day and of the same concrete as the parking lot that surrounds it. On a foggy day everything is gray &mdash; the lake, the sky, the statue &mdash; and the penguin seems to be praying for summer sun. Its nose pointing upward is a happy perch for black crows flying by.","1100 Lake Merced Blvd., San Francisco",37.7113127,-122.4853533,13635096,"Nicole Boliaux, The Chronicle",landscape
The Gateway,"""Penguins,"" made of red porphyry and stainless steel on a concrete pad, is hard to find because it is not among the sculptures in Sydney Walker Square where you expect to find it. It is across the street in a small plaza between Safeway and Starbucks, and camouflaged by the arches of the apartments behind it. It is a sister of the penguins at the Lake Merced and the Stanford Court, only in smoother skin.","460 Davis Court., San Francisco",37.7965722,-122.398825,13635131,"Nicole Boliaux, The Chronicle",landscape

St. Mary's Square,"""Sun Yat-Sen.""

University Club of San Francisco,"Inside this private club on Nob Hill is the only Bufano distinguished enough to have a bar named after it &mdash; the Black Cat. The sleek life-sized sculpture with a bite out of its ear, was once a fixture at the Press Club, it was traded by the artists for room and drink. In its day, the Press Club regularly invited politicians and dignitaries to ""Gang Night Dinner,"" and the rule was if the dignitary stood behind the Black Cat, everything said was off-the-record. It now sits on its bar, waiting to tell its story.","800 Powell St., San Francisco",37.7923442,-122.409034,13632614,"Chris Stewart, The Chronicle",landscape
